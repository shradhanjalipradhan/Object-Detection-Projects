**Project Title: Object Detection Web Application with YOLOv8**

### Overview
This project aims to develop a web application for real-time object detection in videos using YOLOv8, Streamlit, and OpenCV. It enables users to upload videos, detect objects within frames, and visualize results with bounding boxes.

### Features
- Utilizes YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model known for its accuracy and speed.
- Implements a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit, simplifying interaction and deployment.
- Integrates OpenCV for image processing and object detection functionalities.
- Supports video uploading functionality to analyze user-provided content.
- Enables custom class selection to focus on specific object categories.
- Provides visual feedback with bounding boxes around detected objects.
- Offers an intuitive user experience with straightforward navigation and controls.

### Technologies Used
- YOLOv8: A powerful object detection model
- Streamlit: A web app framework for building interactive applications
- OpenCV: A computer vision library for image and video processing

### Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Streamlit app with `streamlit run app.py`.
4. Upload a video file to analyze object detection in real-time.
5. Select desired object classes or use default settings.
6. View the detected objects with bounding boxes overlaid on the video frames.

### Future Improvements
- Incorporate additional object detection models for comparison.
- Enhance performance optimizations for faster inference on large videos.
- Implement object tracking for continuous monitoring across frames.
- Integrate with cloud services for scalability and accessibility.
- Improve UI/UX design for a more polished user interface.
